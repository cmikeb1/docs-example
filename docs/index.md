# First Annual Interopion US-Based Engineering Summit

## Software Development LifeCycle

### Design Outputs
1. Functional Architecture
	* Component diagram
	* Not how they interact, but where they fit with short descriptions
2. Logical Design
	* Not really how, but more what. For example “a proxy”, but not what that proxy is implemented in (NGINX, Java, etc).
3. Sequence Diagram & Physical Diagram
	* Not useful until we get pretty far along
	* Would be useful for estimating costs

### Iteration Planning
2-3 week iterations

### Branching
* We will use GitFlow
* We will use semantic versioning

### Things to Note
* Code reviews
* Git branching model
* Testing
